                In the future, I aim to become a data analyst and skilled 
                on database management and web development, with strong knowledge about SQL and
                expertise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I envision myself that i can create web pages 
                with user-friendly interfaces, i also vision myself to work with big companies or maybe
                become a project manager and have a chief positions.

                In the coming years I'm also skilled in communication, leadership and 
                more responsible than my recent self. I'm also looking for myself for more improvements
                and gain more knowledge both on logcial and non-logical traits.
