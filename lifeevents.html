            <p>
                There are moments that i need to have choice that i need to choose
                and also the consequences of the choices my made, the example ot that is during 
                my high school days when i try to chose what subject that i find more exciting to learn
                either Industrial arts or ICT 
            </p>
        </div>  

        <div class="text2">
            <p>
                When i want to chose Industrial arts my friend said it is better to 
                choose ICT since it is easier and not that difficult, but i realize is kinda bad
                i still trying to adjust and adapt that time since I'm not that tech-savvy and not great when 
                handling computers but still it also shape my future.
